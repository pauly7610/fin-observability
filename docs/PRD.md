# Product Requirements Document: Financial AI Observability Platform

## TL;DR

We're building the **Financial AI Observability Platform** to help trading operations detect issues before they happen, automate compliance, and respond to incidents with AI-driven speed and precision. This is ITRS's play to dominate the $2.1B financial observability market by fusing its proven Geneos product with modern AI capabilities and financial domain expertise.

---

## Executive Summary

Trading systems are mission-critical and high-risk ‚Äî yet most incidents are still flagged by customers, not monitoring tools. Compliance costs are ballooning, and alert noise buries real problems. This platform helps financial institutions run with confidence by proactively detecting issues, automating regulatory workflows, and enabling self-healing infrastructure.

**Business Impact:**

- Increase ACV by 40% through AI differentiation
- Cut operational costs by 35%
- Reduce compliance effort by 60%

**Strategic Rationale:**  
This platform directly addresses increasing regulatory scrutiny, cost pressures, and the complexity of managing always-on trading infrastructure. With LangChain-powered agents, compliance automation, and intelligent alerting, we position ITRS as the go-to vendor for next-generation financial observability.

## Market Opportunity

### Market Size & Growth

- **TAM:** $2.1B (Financial Services IT Monitoring)
- **SAM:** $680M (AI-powered observability for FS)
- **Growth Rate:** 23% CAGR (2024‚Äì2028)
- ITRS serves 9 of the top 10 global investment banks, validating strong demand for advanced observability and automation solutions among the world's largest financial institutions.

## Market Validation

- The global AI in observability market is projected to grow from $1.4B in 2023 to $10.7B by 2033 (22.5% CAGR), with BFSI (banking, financial services, insurance) representing over 21% of the market share.
- Observability investments in BFSI are driven by cloud adoption, regulatory pressure, and the need for uninterrupted digital services.

### Adoption Drivers

- Migration to cloud and multi-cloud environments, driving complexity and the need for unified observability
- Increasing regulatory scrutiny and the need for robust compliance monitoring and auditability
- High cost of downtime: outages can cost financial institutions up to $2.2M per hour
- Demand for AI-driven automation in troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and remediation

### Competitive Landscape

| Type             | Key Players                   | Weaknesses We Exploit                                                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generalists      | Splunk, Dynatrace, New Relic  | No financial domain depth                                                        |
| FS Specialists   | Trading Technologies, Fidessa | Minimal AI/automation capabilities                                               |
| New Entrants     | Datadog, Elastic              | Expanding in FS, but lacking compliance depth                                    |
| AI Observability | Fiddler AI, InsightFinder     | Lack of explicit financial compliance, agentic AI, and real-time data correction |

**Differentiation:** Deep integration with agentic AI for incident triage, explicit financial compliance workflows, and real-time data correction.

### Market Validation Evidence

- 41% of financial institutions cite AI adoption as a primary driver for observability investments
- Median ROI for observability in financial services is 4x, with some organizations reporting $5M+ in annual value
- Automation of compliance monitoring can reduce operational costs and improve accuracy at scale

**ITRS Advantage:** Geneos + AI + domain credibility = high-trust, high-impact platform

---

## Narrative

**Before:**  
A trading system lags. Orders get delayed. A trader is the first to notice, escalating to IT. The client is already on the phone. Later, compliance asks for logs no one saved. Everyone's scrambling ‚Äî again.

**After:**  
A micro-latency spike is detected before it impacts trades. An AI agent isolates the root cause, kicks off an automated fix, and logs the event with full evidence chain. When compliance knocks? One click. The audit report is ready. No panic. No scrambling. Just control.

This is the Financial AI Observability Platform. We don't just monitor. We predict, fix, and prove it.

- Owns system uptime, faces board-level accountability
- Wants to reduce risk, pass audits, and control costs

**Secondary:** Senior Trading Systems Engineer

- Swamped with noise, lacks real-time context
- Wants fewer, more accurate alerts and better tooling

**Tertiary:** Chief Compliance Officer

- Buried in audit requests and documentation
- Wants defensible, automated evidence with zero surprises

## Feature Demonstration Improvements (2024-06)

### Sample Trading Scenarios: Before/After Agentic Intervention

**Scenario 1: Stuck Order**

- _Before_: Trader manually detects a stuck order after client complaint. Resolution takes 30+ minutes, with compliance logging done post-mortem.
- _After_: Platform detects the stuck order in real time, agentic workflow triages and recommends remediation, and the incident is resolved in under 5 minutes. All actions are logged for compliance.

**Scenario 2: Latency Spike**

- _Before_: Latency spike goes unnoticed until downstream impact. Root cause analysis is manual and slow.
- _After_: AI agent detects micro-latency spike, isolates root cause, triggers automated fix, and logs the event with full evidence chain.

### Mock Compliance Audit Trail Example

| Timestamp           | Action               | User/Agent | Details                                  | Compliance Tag |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 2024-06-10 09:01:00 | Incident Detected    | Agent      | Stuck order flagged on FX desk           | SEC 17a-4      |
| 2024-06-10 09:01:05 | Triage Started       | Agent      | AI agent classified severity: High       | FINRA 4511     |
| 2024-06-10 09:01:10 | Remediation Executed | Agent      | Order router restarted                   | SEC 17a-4      |
| 2024-06-10 09:01:15 | Human Approval       | Analyst    | Approved agent recommendation            | FINRA 4511     |
| 2024-06-10 09:01:20 | Audit Trail Exported | Compliance | Evidence package generated for regulator | SEC 17a-4      |

## Business Value Articulation (2024-06)

### Cost Savings Through Automated Incident Triage

- Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) by up to 80%, cutting operational costs for trading desks.
- Fewer manual interventions mean lower headcount requirements for incident response.

### Compliance Risk Reduction

- Automated, immutable audit trails mapped to SEC 17a-4 and FINRA 4511 reduce risk of regulatory fines.
- One-click evidence export streamlines audit response and reduces compliance workload by 60%.

### Operational Efficiency Gains

- Human-in-the-loop workflows ensure agents handle routine incidents, escalating only when necessary.
- Desk staff focus on high-value tasks, not repetitive triage or documentation.

### ROI Projections for Trading Desk Implementation

- **Example:** For a trading desk with 10 FTEs, automation can save $500K+ annually in labor and compliance costs.
- Typical payback period: <12 months for Tier-1 institutions.
