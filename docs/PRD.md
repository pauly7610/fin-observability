# Product Requirements Document: Financial AI Observability Platform


## TL;DR

We're building the **Financial AI Observability Platform** to help trading operations detect issues before they happen, automate compliance, and respond to incidents with AI-driven speed and precision. This is ITRS‚Äôs play to dominate the $2.1B financial observability market by fusing its proven Geneos product with modern AI capabilities and financial domain expertise.

## Executive Summary

Trading systems are mission-critical and high-risk ‚Äî yet most incidents are still flagged by customers, not monitoring tools. Compliance costs are ballooning, and alert noise buries real problems. This platform helps financial institutions run with confidence by proactively detecting issues, automating regulatory workflows, and enabling self-healing infrastructure.

**Business Impact:**  
- Increase ACV by 40% through AI differentiation  
- Cut operational costs by 35%  
- Reduce compliance effort by 60%

**Strategic Rationale:**  
This platform directly addresses increasing regulatory scrutiny, cost pressures, and the complexity of managing always-on trading infrastructure. With LangChain-powered agents, compliance automation, and intelligent alerting, we position ITRS as the go-to vendor for next-generation financial observability.

## Market Opportunity

### Market Size & Growth
- **TAM:** $2.1B (Financial Services IT Monitoring)
- **SAM:** $680M (AI-powered observability for FS)

### Competitive Landscape
| Type                | Key Players                       | Weaknesses We Exploit                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Generalists         | Splunk, Dynatrace, New Relic      | No financial domain depth                      |
| FS Specialists      | Trading Technologies, Fidessa     | Minimal AI/automation capabilities             |
| New Entrants        | Datadog, Elastic                  | Expanding in FS, but lacking compliance depth  |

**ITRS Advantage:** Geneos + AI + domain credibility = high-trust, high-impact platform

## Narrative

**Before:**  
A trading system lags. Orders get delayed. A trader is the first to notice, escalating to IT. The client is already on the phone. Later, compliance asks for logs no one saved. Everyone‚Äôs scrambling ‚Äî again.

**After:**  
A micro-latency spike is detected before it impacts trades. An AI agent isolates the root cause, kicks off an automated fix, and logs the event with full evidence chain. When compliance knocks? One click. The audit report is ready. No panic. No scrambling. Just control.

This is the Financial AI Observability Platform. We don‚Äôt just monitor. We predict, fix, and prove it.

## Problem Statement

### Core Problem

Tier-1 trading operations teams struggle with:
- **Reactive Monitoring:** 78% of incidents are discovered by customers, not systems
- **Alert Fatigue:** 12,000+ daily alerts, 94% false positives¬π
- **Manual Compliance:** 40+ hours/week spent preparing audit documentation
- **Operational Risk:** $45M/hour avg. cost of trading downtime¬≤

### Target Personas

**Primary:** Head of Trading Operations  
- Owns system uptime, faces board-level accountability  
- Wants to reduce risk, pass audits, and control costs

**Secondary:** Senior Trading Systems Engineer  
- Swamped with noise, lacks real-time context  
- Wants fewer, more accurate alerts and better tooling

**Tertiary:** Chief Compliance Officer  
- Buried in audit requests and documentation  
- Wants defensible, automated evidence with zero surprises
